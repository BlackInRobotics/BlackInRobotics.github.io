Prof. Guy directs the [Applied Motion Lab](http://motion.cs.umn.edu). His research focuses on the development of artificial intelligence for use in autonomous robotics (e.g., collision avoidance and path planning under uncertainty) and computer simulations of human movement and behavior (e.g., crowd simulation and virtual characters).
