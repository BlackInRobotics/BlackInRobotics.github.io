Prof. Wade develops innovative technologies to help with rehabilitation for people with disabilities, for example by sensing and quantifying recovery through activity recognition. At CalPoly, he leads the Behavior, Robotics, and Sensing Group, which is focused on influencing human behavior using robotics and virtual reality, and quantifying changes in behavior using sensing and machine learning approaches.
