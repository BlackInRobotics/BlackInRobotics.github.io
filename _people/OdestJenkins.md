Prof. Jenkins leads the [Laboratory for Progress](http://progress.eecs.umich.edu/) and is Associate Chair of Undergraduate Studies for the Michigan Robotics Institute. His research addresses problems in interactive robotics and human-robot interaction, primarily focused on mobile manipulation, robot perception, and robot learning from demonstration.  Prof. Jenkins does not believe celebrity lists alone will lead to systemic fairness in robotics and its [merit review and support of Black roboticists at all levels](https://venturebeat.com/2020/08/08/before-we-put-100-billion-into-ai/).
