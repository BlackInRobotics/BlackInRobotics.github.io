Prof. Zelik leads the [Biomechanics & Assistive Technology Laboratory](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/batlab/) and co-founded [HeroWear](https://herowearexo.com/), an exosuit spin-off company from his lab. He strives to improve health and mobility for individuals with disabilities, and to enhance human capabilities by engineering and understanding technologies such as prostheses, exoskeletons, smart clothing and wearables that physically augment human performance and well-being.
