Prof. Brown runs the [Biomechatronic Learning Laboratory](https://www.rit.edu/kgcoe/electrical/bll/index.html) where he studies Rehabilitation Robotics. He focuses on developing intelligent orthotics and wearable robotic systems that use human physical and physiological information to aid individuals with diseases and disabilities that affect the skeletal musculature of their upper-limb extremities.
