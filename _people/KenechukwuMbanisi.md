Kenechukwu (fondly called ‘Kene’) is very passionate about two things: (1) working with students to tinker and design human-compatible robotics and A.I. systems that create value for people and (2) inspiring and enabling the next generation of engineers and roboticists from under-represented backgrounds in robotics and A.I. Kene is deeply committed to equity and access in STEM education and contributes to a number of community outreach programs. He serves as the coordinator of the Pan-African Robotics Competition (PARC) Engineers League, a program that mentors young aspiring robotics enthusiasts from over thirty African countries.
