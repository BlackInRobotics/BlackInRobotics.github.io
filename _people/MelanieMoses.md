Prof. Moses leads the [Moses Biological Computation Lab](https://moseslab.cs.unm.edu/) which seeks to create models of biological systems and apply the insights gained from those systems to swarm robotics. Additionally, Prof. Moses is the PI for two programs seeking to diversify computer science: [NM CSforAll](https://cs4all.cs.unm.edu/) and [NASA Swarmathon](http://nasaswarmathon.com/).
