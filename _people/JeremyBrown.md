Prof. Brown runs the [Haptics and Medical Robotics (HAMR) lab](https://hamr.lcsr.jhu.edu/) and his research sits at the intersection of engineering, biomechatronics, medicine, and psychophysics. He develops novel haptic interfaces for upper-limb prosthetics and minimally invasive surgical robotics.
