Prof. Bell founded and directs the [Photoacoustic and Ultrasonic Systems Engineering (PULSE) Lab](https://pulselab.jhu.edu/). Her lab introduced the concept of teleoperative photacoustic-guided surgery using the da Vinci surgical system, the first study of its kind combining photoacoustic imaging and minimally invasive robotic surgeries to improve accuracy. She pioneers work in medical imaging technology, robot-assisted imaging, and machine learning for image formation.
