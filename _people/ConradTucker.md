Prof. Tucker leads the [Artificial Intelligence in Products Engineered for X (AiPEX) Lab](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/faculty/aipex.html). He explores the use of machine learning methods that predictively improve the outcome of product design solutions through the acquisition, fusion, and mining of large-scale, publicly-available data.
