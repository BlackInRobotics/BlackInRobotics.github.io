Prof. Johnson directs the [Rehabilitation Robotics Lab](https://www.med.upenn.edu/rehabilitation-robotics-lab/). Her research is mainly in the area of robot-mediated rehabilitation, in particular exploring the relationships between brain plasticity and behavioral/motor control changes after robot-assisted interventions, quantifying motor impairment and motor control of the upper limb in real world tasks such as drinking, and defining the methods to maintain therapeutic effectiveness while administering local and remote, robot-mediated interventions.
