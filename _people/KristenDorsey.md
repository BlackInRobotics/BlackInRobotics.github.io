Prof. Dorsey leads the [MicroSmithie lab](http://www.science.smith.edu/microsmithy/). Kristen Dorsey's research focuses on the fabrication and characterization of micro-scale sensors and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). She likes to understand “why things go wrong” by investigating device reliability and stability. Her current and previous work has had applications in actuation, gas chemical sensing, and inertial sensing.
