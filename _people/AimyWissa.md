Prof. Wissa directs the [Bio-inspired Adaptive Morphology Laboratory](https://bamlab.mechse.illinois.edu/) and has pioneered many new ideas in the field of bio-inspired robotics, particularly in the areas of avian-inspired wing design, insect-like locomotion, and multi-functional morphing structures.
